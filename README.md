## Installation

The Readable app requires a backend server for the Front End to work with. Install the api server from here:

`git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git readable-server`

	- `cd readable-server/api-server`
	- `npm install`
	- `node server`

Now you are ready to rock. Lets get the front end framework and get that running. In another directory do the following:

`git clone https://github.com/pixelprogrammer/udacity-readable.git readable`

	- `cd readable`
	- `npm install`
	- `npm start`

Visit localhost:3000 to view the Readable site.
